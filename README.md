# Environment Dashboard

The Environment Dashboard is a web application that visualizes environmental data in a user-friendly and interactive manner. It provides a comprehensive overview of various environmental metrics and allows users to explore and analyze the data effectively.

## Features

1. **Data Table Display**:
   - The application displays a table containing all the environmental data on the front-end.
   - Users can easily view and navigate through the data in a tabular format.

2. **Metric Charts**:
   - The dashboard includes charts for all the available environmental metrics.
   - When a user hovers the mouse over a specific data point in a chart, additional information related to that data point is displayed.
   - The charts provide a clear and intuitive way to understand the trends and patterns in the environmental data.

3. **Interactive Data Synchronization**:
   - When a user makes changes to the data in the table and click "Save" button, the corresponding chart below automatically updates to reflect the modifications.
   - This real-time synchronization ensures that the charts always display the most up-to-date information based on the data in the table.
